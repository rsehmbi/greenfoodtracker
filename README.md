### 1. Overview
The Green Food Challenge application aims to help people collectively reduce greenhouse
gas emissions in Metro Vancouver.
### 2. Background
As Canadians, we often think of ourselves as surrounded by nature and thoughtful about
the environment. Since 2011, Vancouver has spearheaded the Greenest City Action Plan, with the goal of becoming the greenest city in the world by 2020. One of the plan's ten goals is to have a lighter footprint by reducing Vancouver's carbon
footprint by 33% over 2006 levels.

## What is a carbon footprint?
Greenhouse gases, measured in CO2e (CO2 equivalents), are known to directly contribute
to climate change, and include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. In 2015,
regional emissions in Metro Vancouver were projected to be 14.9 million tonnes of CO2e,
between 6-8 tonnes per capita. In other words, we can then say that our personal carbon
footprint is about 6-8 tonnes of CO2e. However, it is generally estimated that global
emissions must be reduced to approximately 2 tonnes per capita by 2050.

## What contributes to greenhouse gases?
There are many CO2e contributors to our carbon footprint, including transportation and
buildings (commercial, residential) . Municipalities and businesses are currently
undertaking measures to reduce their footprints. For example, Metro Vancouver transit can
be promoted over cars, and buildings are changing their heating systems from natural gas
to hydroelectric.

Despite these efforts at the governmental level, at the current pace of change, it is unlikely
we will meet the 2020 target.What else can we do to mitigate climate change? Aside from taking transit, is there anything else we can do as individuals?

The carbon impact of Food is generally under-reported as a source of CO2e. For instance in Europe, agriculture
contributes to 10% of the carbon footprint. In particular, ruminants such as sheep and
cows produce methane through enteric fermentation (i.e. they pass gas) and produce more
CO2e than other types of animals. According to the European Commission, the vast
majority of methane emissions (85%) come from ruminants’ digestion.

A Low Carbon Diet

There are 2.46 million people living in the Metro Vancouver area, and about 90% of them
eat food that are relatively high in CO2e (i.e., are non-vegetarian). If each of those people,
for instance, reduced beef/lamb from 35% to 10% and instead ate chicken, Vancouver
could save 900,000 to 1 million tonnes of CO2e per year.

## Green Food Challenge

In this project, we aim to raise awareness and promote behaviour change by running the
Green Food Challenge. In this challenge, people install a mobile application to learn how
much their diet produces in terms of CO2e, and discover how much CO2e they (and their
greater community) could save by making dietary adjustments.
Over the course of the Green Food Challenge, participants track their "green meals",
containing chicken, seafood or vegetable-based proteins. Participants would see how many
tonnes of CO2e they save together as a community, as well as share restaurants that offer
delicious “low carbon” meals. By incentivizing these CO2e-friendly meals, it is hoped that
participants learn to sustainably change their eating habits towards a lighter footprint.

## Specifications
The Green Food Challenge application will be created in 3 phases (sprints):
1. Green Food Challenge Carbon Calculator
2. Green Food Challenge Group Pledge
3. Green Food Challenge Restaurant Guide

## Green Food Challenge Pledge
The goal of this phase is to allow participants to make a pledge to reduce Metro Vancouver's CO2e emissions,
see how people in the community are pledging, and share the challenge with others through social media.

## Green Food Challenge Restaurant Guide
The goal of this phase is to allow participants to share the locations and pictures of the food they are eating,
and view what others have shared. Participants can help others in the community find “low
carbon” options. For example, SFU Burnaby students can post about the falafel wrap at Donair
Town, the sushi at Togo Sushi, and the Beyond Meat Burger at A&W.
